# Project Tasks (High-Level)

## How To Use This File

- Each `Hxx` item is intentionally high-level and should be investigated through subtasks in planning mode.
- Create subtasks only when starting work on one `Hxx`; keep this file stable as the top-level map.
- Move completed `Hxx` entries and their subtasks to `TASKS-done.md`.
Done history moved to `TASKS-done.md`.

## Active

- [ ] `H20` Google Scholar (PoP) user-onboarding into Scholardex.
  Goal: support user-triggered Google Scholar imports from Publish-or-Perish exports as first-class canonical ingestion into Scholardex identity/link models.
  Deliverable: user-operation onboarding flow for PoP exports (upload/import from user surface) with parser + ingest adapter into Scholar-source events/facts and linker integration with Scholardex entities.
  Exit criteria: Scholar imported records from user operations link deterministically and preserve source lineage without mutating non-owned fields; no separate non-user onboarding path is required in this slice.
  Dependency: execute after `H19.9` citation canonicalization so imported Scholar citation edges are canonical-ID compatible at ingest time.

- [ ] `H61` Citation exclusion "any co-author" mode (Scopus all-authors self-citation) for Informatică.
  Goal: add a third citation-exclusion mode — exclude a citation when the citing work shares **any** author
  with the *cited* publication (not only the candidate) — for the upcoming Informatică standard. Today we
  support only `CITATIONS` (count all) and `CITATIONS_EXCLUDE_SELF` (candidate-only, which matches Ordin
  6129/2016 Matematică).
  Notable: the only conceptual change is the comparison set — `CANDIDATE_ONLY` uses the candidate's resolved
  IDs (today), `ANY_COAUTHOR` uses the cited publication's full author set (`cited.getAuthors()`); both filter
  sites (`ReportScopedIndicatorScoringSupport` score path + `CitationRowProjector` display path) already
  iterate per cited pub. `ANY_COAUTHOR` ⊇ `CANDIDATE_ONLY`. Replace `Citations(boolean excludeSelf,…)` with a
  3-value `SelfCitationPolicy`; add legacy token `CITATIONS_EXCLUDE_COAUTHORS`; no data migration (existing
  strings unchanged); cache fingerprint invalidates automatically via `toLegacy()`.
  Deliverable: the enum + codec + getter, both filter sites switched by policy, admin-editor option, tests
  (non-candidate-co-author excluded under the new mode, kept under candidate-only), then re-point Informatică
  citation indicator(s).
  Exit criteria: round-trips through `of()`/`toLegacy()`; existing Citations indicators unaffected; both paths
  agree on the per-cited-paper overlap; unlinked-author identity-matching caveat covered. Planning doc at
  `docs/tasks/active/h61-citation-coauthor-exclusion.md`.

- [ ] `H60` Relative year specs (recent-window + latest-rankings) for indicator scoring.
  Goal: replace fixed absolute year ranges (which go stale yearly) with self-rolling relative windows — `YearRangeSpec.PreviousNYears(n)` (article inclusion, t‑n…t‑1) and `ScoreYearRangeSpec.LatestNRankings(n)` (the n most recent ranking list-years present in the DB, ≤ the run's referenceYear). Anchored on a `referenceYear` stored on `UserIndividualReportRun` for deterministic replay.
  Notable: `yearRangeSpec` is currently NOT enforced in scoring (dead config) — inclusion filtering is net-new; `LatestNRankings` resolves against the DB's ranking years (not the journal's own) so a journal dropped from the latest list is correctly excluded rather than falling back to a stale year.
  Deliverable: the two new sealed-type records + reference-year threading through the scoring chain (incl. the re-scoring export/detail path), enforced publication-year inclusion filtering, a cached "distinct ranking list-years" lookup, admin-editor support, and migration; then re-point the FV Matematică indicators (`Mate_S_recent`→PreviousNYears(7); scoreYearRanges→LatestNRankings(1)).
  Exit criteria: relative specs resolve deterministically from (referenceYear, DB ranking years), excluded-journal + boundary cases tested; inclusion filtering enforced without regressing AllYears indicators; a run stores referenceYear and replay is stable across later ranking imports; replay-shape guard green. Planning doc at `docs/tasks/active/h60-relative-year-specs.md`.

- [ ] `H50` Individual report export / read-only score-verification import.
  Goal: enable users to export a `UserIndividualReportRun` to a per-report-type template and to upload a corrected file for a transient, read-only score verification (file scores vs the persisted run; never writes, never auto-creates a run). The original 4-bucket reconcile/commit design was superseded (2026-05-19) and its dead code removed (2026-06-14).
  Done: `ReportInstanceSnapshot` DTO + registry (H50.1); xlsx exporter + template for `informatica-2016` (H50.2); xlsx score-verification import across publications/citations/activities — parse+evaluate, per-item+totals comparison UI, `importEnabled` toggle (H50.3); run-backed export, verify-vs-displayed-run, `ReportExportReadinessValidator`, and typed `ExportFailureReason` mapping.
  Remaining: docx exporter (H50.4) and docx import (H50.6); extend to the other report types (H50.5) — only `informatica-2016` has a binding today, so the other four definitions can't export/verify.
  Exit criteria: each supported report type round-trips export → edit → upload → read-only verify (file-vs-run per-item + totals, no DB writes); xlsx-formula injection and docx-macro inputs are rejected/sanitized; misconfigured export mappings fail readiness instead of silently dropping rows.
  Dependency: none direct; planning doc at `docs/tasks/active/h50-individual-report-export-import.md`.
