# Project Recovery Tasks (High-Level)

Objective: raise runtime functional quality from baseline-safe behavior to production-grade correctness and resilience.

Done history moved to `TASKS-done.md`.

## Backlog

- [ ] `H13` Workflow-level functional confidence suite.
  Goal: move beyond slice-level guardrails and prove critical user/admin business workflows end-to-end under realistic conditions.
  Deliverable: focused high-value functional test suite (multi-step user/admin/report/export flows) with deterministic fixtures and clear pass/fail contracts.
  Exit criteria: top business workflows are validated across success and failure paths, and functional regressions are caught before merge by repeatable automated checks.
  Subtasks:
  - [ ] `H13.1` Admin WoS maintenance end-to-end flow.
    Deliverable: deterministic workflow test for admin-triggered WoS maintenance chain (ingest -> facts -> projections -> verify) including authorization checks.
    Exit criteria: success and unauthorized/failure paths are both asserted.
  - [ ] `H13.2` User indicator refresh/export workflow.
    Deliverable: deterministic workflow test covering indicator refresh and export from user-facing flow.
    Exit criteria: refresh updates persisted score state and export contract remains stable.
  - [ ] `H13.3` Failure-path workflow gate.
    Deliverable: at least one full workflow-level degraded/failure scenario with deterministic error handling assertions.
    Exit criteria: failure mode is reproducible and blocks regressions.

- [ ] `H17` Scopus canonical import pipeline transition.
  Goal: replace direct Scopus document writes with a canonical ingestion pipeline aligned to WoS patterns (`events -> facts -> views`) for deterministic replay and safer evolution.
  Deliverable: high-level migration to Scopus import events ledger, normalized Scopus facts layer, and projection views consumed by application/reporting flows.
  Exit criteria: Scopus ingest is replayable/idempotent from source events, canonical facts are the single derivation source, read paths use stable views/contracts, and parity/guardrail checks protect against regressions.

## How To Use This File

- Each `Hxx` item is intentionally high-level and should be investigated through subtasks in planning mode.
- Create subtasks only when starting work on one `Hxx`; keep this file stable as the top-level map.
- Move completed `Hxx` entries and their subtasks to `TASKS-done.md`.
